<h1>This is the github repo for the project.</h1>
<h1>Name of project: Video Creator</h1>
<h1>Names of members: Jason Ferrer, Sean Quevedo, Manjit Gurcha</h1>
<h1>Class: CST205</h1>
<h1>Date: 12/10/2017</h1>
<h1>How to Run Program: First make sure that you have 'FFMPEG' installed (this creates the video) and that you also have all the modules needed installed. Download all files to directory and run the 'main.py' file, which would open the GUI. Then search for a image and  choose a filter. The image will be saved automatically. Select save all images after you are done selecting images, select audio, and then create video!</h1>

<h1>Future Work: Plans to modify it to have the video have more pictures and to also find a way for the video to play directly inside the gui. Also, to find a different way to create a video with a different module.</h1>
